    "data_protection": "AES-256 encryption + secure storage",
    "network_security": "HTTPS + CORS + basic headers",
    "monitoring": "Basic logging + error tracking",
    "compliance": "Basic documentation + legal setup",
    "infrastructure": "Docker + PostgreSQL + Redis",
    "incident_response": "Manual alerts + basic runbooks"
}
```

### **MVP Security Benefits**
