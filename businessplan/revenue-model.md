# GambleGlee Revenue Model

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

GambleGlee operates on a **commission-based revenue model** similar to betting exchanges like Betfair or stock trading platforms. Unlike traditional casinos, we don't have a house edge - instead, we earn revenue through transparent fees on betting activity.

## ðŸ’° Core Revenue Streams

### 1. Betting Commission (Primary Revenue - 80%)

**How it works**: GambleGlee takes a percentage of every bet placed on the platform.

#### Commission Structure

```yaml
standard_rates:
  regular_bets: "5%" # Standard trick shot bets
  live_events: "3%" # Live streaming events (lower for volume)
  friend_bets: "2%" # Bets between friends (loyalty discount)
  premium_members: "3%" # Premium users get lower rates
  high_volume: "2%" # Users betting >$1000/month
```

#### Tiered Commission Based on User Activity

```yaml
user_tiers:
  bronze: "5% commission" # New users (0-99 bets)
  silver: "4% commission" # 100+ bets
  gold: "3% commission" # 500+ bets
  platinum: "2% commission" # 1000+ bets
  diamond: "1% commission" # 5000+ bets
```

#### Example Revenue Calculation

```python
# EXAMPLE: $100 bet between two users
bet_example = {
    "bet_amount": 100.00,           # Users bet $100 each
    "total_pot": 200.00,            # Total pot is $200
    "gambleglee_commission": 5.0,   # 5% commission = $10
    "winner_gets": 190.00,           # Winner receives $190
    "gambleglee_earns": 10.00       # GambleGlee earns $10
}
```

### 2. Transaction Fees (Secondary Revenue - 15%)

**How it works**: Fees on deposits, withdrawals, and currency conversions.

#### Fee Structure

```yaml
transaction_fees:
  deposit_fee: "2.9% + $0.30" # Stripe processing fee
  withdrawal_fee: "$5.00" # Fixed withdrawal fee
  currency_conversion: "1.5%" # USD to MXN conversion
  premium_withdrawal: "$2.00" # Premium users get lower fees
```

#### Example Transaction Revenue

```python
# EXAMPLE: $1000 deposit and $500 withdrawal
transaction_example = {
    "deposit_amount": 1000.00,
    "stripe_fee": 29.30,          # 2.9% + $0.30
    "gambleglee_keeps": 29.30,    # GambleGlee keeps processing fee

    "withdrawal_amount": 500.00,
    "withdrawal_fee": 5.00,       # Fixed $5 fee
    "gambleglee_keeps": 5.00,     # GambleGlee keeps withdrawal fee

    "total_fees": 34.30           # Total transaction revenue
}
```
